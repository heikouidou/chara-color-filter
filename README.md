# 🎨 SillyTavern Chara Color Filter

An extension for SillyTavern that automatically applies a color filter to character sprites based on the background's average color.
It helps characters blend into the scene naturally, creating a more immersive experience!

## ✨ Features
* **Auto-Blending**: Automatically detects the background image's average color and tints the character sprite.
* **Blend Modes**: Supports various blend modes (Overlay, Multiply, Soft Light, etc.) via the extension settings.
* **Persist Settings**: Remembers your preferred blend mode even after reloading.
* **Non-Destructive**: Select "None" to instantly revert to the original look.
* **Performance Friendly**: Uses debounce and efficient observers to minimize impact.
